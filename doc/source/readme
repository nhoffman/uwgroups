Implements a subset of the UW Groups REST API
(https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/infra/Groups+Web+Service+REST+API)
that I find useful. Under development.

dependencies
============

* Python 2.7.x
* Tested on Linux and OS X.

installation
============

For now, install directly from GitHub::

  pip install git+https://github.com/nhoffman/uwgroups.git

CLI
===

After installation, the CLI entry point is called ``uwgroups``. For
development, you can invoke the ``uwgroups.py`` from within the cloned
repo::

    % cd uwgroups
    % ./uwgroups.py --help

or::

   % path/to/uwgroups/uwgroups.py --help

When invoked this way, the local version of the package is imported,
even if the version of the package is installed to the system. This is
very handy for development, and can avoid the requirement for a
virtualenv in many cases.

Commands are constructed as follows. Every command starts with the
name of the script, followed by an "action" followed by a series of
required or optional "arguments". The name of the script, the action,
and options and their arguments are entered on the command line
separated by spaces. Help text is available for both the ``uwgroups``
script and individual actions using the ``-h`` or ``--help`` options.

authentication
==============

Authentication to the UW Groups API uses SSL/TLS authentication with
an X.509 certificate in pem format along with the private key used to
generate it. The certificate and key may be concatenated into the same
file, for example::

  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  <key contents>
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <cert contents>
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----

In this case, the concatenated key and cert can either be specified on
the command line using ``-c/--cert-file`` before the name of the
subcommand::

  uwgroups -c certfile.pem connect

or using the environment variable ``UWGROUPS_CERT``::

  export UWGROUPS_CERT=certfile.pem
  uwgroups connect

The key may also be provided in a separate fie using ``-k/--key-file``
or ``UWGROUPS_KEY`` as above.

unit tests
==========

Unit tests are implemented using the ``unittest`` module in the Python
standard library. The ``tests`` subdirectory is itself a Python
package that implements the tests. All unit tests can be run like this::

    % python setup.py test

A single unit test can be run by referring to a specific module,
class, or method within the ``tests`` package using dot notation::

    % python setup.py test --test-suite tests.test_utils
